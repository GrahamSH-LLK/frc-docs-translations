"These encoders vary in how they are mounted to the mechanism in question.  "
"In addition to these types of encoders, many FRC mechanisms come with "
"quadrature encoders integrated into their design."
msgstr "这些编码器的安装方式有所不同。除了这些类型的编码器，许多队伍还将正交编码器集成到机械设计中。"

"The term \"quadrature\" refers to the method by which the motion is "
"measured/encoded.  A quadrature encoder produces two square-wave pulses that"
" are 90-degrees out-of-phase from each other, as seen in the picture below:"
msgstr "术语“正交”是指测量/编码运动的方法。正交编码器会产生两个相位相差为90度的方波脉冲，如下图所示："

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/hardware/sensors/encoders-hardware.rst:82
msgid ""
"Thus, across both channels, there are four total \"edges\" per period (hence"
" \"quad\").  The use of two out-of-phase pulses allows the direction of "
"motion to be unambiguously determined from which pulse \"leads\" the other."
msgstr ""
"因此，在这两个信号通道之间，每个周期有四个“边”（因此为“ "
"quad”）。通过判断两个不同相位的信号脉冲，哪个脉冲在另一个脉冲的前面，就可以明确确定运动方向，"

msgid ""
"The acronyms \"CPR\" and \"PPR\" are *both* used by varying sources to "
"denote both edges per revolution *and* cycles per revolution, so the acronym"
" alone is not enough to tell which is of the two is meant when by a given "
"value.  When in doubt, consult the technical manual of your specific "
"encoder."
msgstr ""
"首字母缩写词“ CPR”和“ "
"PPR”被不同的来源*同时*使用，以表示每转的两个边沿*和*每转的循环数，因此仅首字母缩写还不足以说明两者中的哪一个是何时给定的价值。如有疑问，请查阅您特定编码器的技术手册。"

"As encoders measure rotation with digital pulses, the accuracy of the "
"measurement is limited by the number of pulses per given amount of "
"rotational movement.  This is known as the \"resolution\" of the encoder, "
"and is traditionally measured in one of two different ways: edges per "
"revolution, or cycles per revolution."
msgstr ""
"当编码器使用数字脉冲测量旋转时，测量精度受每给定旋转运动量的脉冲数限制。这被称为编码器的“分辨率”，并且通常以两种不同方式之一进行测量：每转的边沿或每转的圈数。"

"*Edges per revolution* refers to the total number of transitions from high-"
"to-low or low-to-high across both channels per revolution of the encoder "
"shaft.  A full period contains *four* edges."
msgstr "*每转边沿*是指编码器轴每转两个通道从高到低或从低到高的过渡总数。一个完整的周期包含*四个*边。"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/hardware/sensors/encoders-hardware.rst:117
msgid ""
"*Cycles per revolution* refers to the total number of *complete periods* of "
"both channels per revolution of the encoder shaft.  A full period is *one* "
"cycle."
msgstr "*每转周期*是指编码器轴每转两个通道的*完整周期*的总数。一个完整的周期是*一*转。"

"Thus, a resolution stated in edges per revolution has a value four times "
"that of the same resolution stated in cycles per revolution."
msgstr "因此，以每转边缘表示的分辨率的值是以每转周期表示的相同分辨率的值的四倍。"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/hardware/sensors/encoders-hardware.rst:121
msgid ""
"In general, the resolution of your encoder in edges-per-revolution should be"
" somewhat finer than your smallest acceptable error in positioning.  Thus, "
"if you want to know the mechanism plus-or-minus one degree, you should have "
"an encoder with a resolution somewhat higher than 360 edges per revolution."
msgstr "通常，编码器每转边的分辨率应比定位中可接受的最小误差稍好。因此，如果您想知道正负一度的机制，则应使用分辨率稍高于每转360个边缘的编码器。"
