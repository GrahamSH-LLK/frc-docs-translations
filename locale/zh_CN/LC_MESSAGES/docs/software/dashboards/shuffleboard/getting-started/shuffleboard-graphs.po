"With Shuffleboard you can graph numeric values over time. Graphs are very. "
"useful to see how sensor or motor values are changing as your robot is "
"operating. For example the sensor value can be graphed in a PID loop to see "
"how it is responding during tuning."
msgstr ""
"使用Shuffleboard，你可以绘制随时间变化的数值。图非常有用，可以看到传感器或电机的值在机器人操作时是如何变化的。例如，传感器的值可以在一个PID环路中被绘制出来，以查看在调整期间它是如何响应的。"

"The graph widget shows line plots of the value that you selected. It will "
