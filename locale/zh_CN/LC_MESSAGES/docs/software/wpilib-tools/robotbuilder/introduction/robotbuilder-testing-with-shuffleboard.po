"This has the added benefit of accommodating multiple programmers, each "
"writing commands. As the code is checked into the main robot project, the "
"commands can be individually tested."
msgstr "这个带来的额外好处是它能够更好地协调数个同时在给出指令的程序部分。当代码被写入机器的主程序项目后，每个指令都可以被拉出来单独调试。"

"The button is created on the SmartDashboard by putting an instance of the "
"command from the robot program to the dashboard. This is such a common "

"automatically generated for you."
