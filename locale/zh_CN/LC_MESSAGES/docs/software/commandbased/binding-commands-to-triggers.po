"Apart from autonomous commands, which are scheduled at the start of the "
"autonomous period, and default commands, which are automatically scheduled "
"whenever their subsystem is not currently in-use, the most common way to run"
" a command is by binding it to a triggering event, such as a button being "
"pressed by a human operator. The command-based paradigm makes this extremely"
" easy to do."
msgstr ""
"除了在自动阶段开始时调度的自动阶段命令以及在当前不使用其子系统的情况下自动调度的缺省命令之外，运行命令的最常见方法是将其绑定到触发事件，例如人工操作员按下的按钮。基于命令的范例使此操作非常容易。"

"Remember that button binding is *declarative*: bindings only need to be "
"declared once, ideally some time during robot initialization. The library "
"handles everything else."
msgstr "请记住，按钮绑定是“声明式”的：绑定只需要声明一次，理想情况下是在机器人初始化期间声明一次。该库处理其他所有事务。"
